        <h6>SUMMARY OF THE MAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</h6>
        <div id="sum-box">
          The products available on this website are directly sold by YOOX
          NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (“YOOX” or the “Vendor”), company subject to
          the management and coordination of Compagnie Financière Richemont
          S.A., with its registered office in Italy, Via Morimondo, 17 - 20143
          Milano. For further information, please visit the Customer Care Area.
          You will find information about purchases, shipping, refunds and
          returning products purchased on the website. Remember that, even after
          your purchase, you may contact YOOX at any time using the online
          contact form or by telephone, when available, using the number
          indicated in the Customer Care Area. You have the right to cancel the
          contract entered into with the Vendor, without any penalty and without
          specifying the reason, within thirty (30) days, starting from the day
          of receipt of the products purchased on this website. In some specific
          cases, duly indicated in the Return Policy section in the Legal Area,
          and only if the service is available, it is possible to exchange the
          chosen garment for another. To cancel the contract, you may use the
          Return Form found in the Customer Care area, which should be completed
          and submitted directly online via the website, or you can send to the
          Vendor the form available on the Legal Area or any other written
          notification explicitly indicating your decision to cancel the
          contract. If you choose to use the Return Form to be submitted online
          via the website, the Vendor will send an email confirming receipt of
          your cancellation request. If you choose one of the other options, you
          shall be responsible for proving that you exercised your right of
          cancellation correctly and in a timely manner. The Right of
          Cancellation is considered to be correctly exercised when the
          following conditions are also fully satisfied: a. The Return Form
          directly submitted online via the website or any other explicit
          notification of your decision to cancel the contract must be correctly
          completed and sent to the Vendor within thirty (30) days, starting
          from the day of receipt of the products; b. the products should not
          have been used, worn, washed; c. the identification tag should still
          be attached to the products with the disposable seal, which forms an
          integral part of the goods; d. the products should be returned in
          their original packaging (in the case of audio CDs, books, design
          objects, designer toys and adult games, the packaging’s original seal
          must be intact; if you wish to return a kit, you must include all of
          the items comprising it); e. the products must be entrusted to the
          courier company within thirty (30) days, starting from the day of
          receipt of the products; f. the products should not be damaged. The
          only costs to be borne by you are those for returning the purchased
          products, except if the Vendor expressly exempted you from such costs
          at the time of the purchase and on the condition that you use the
          courier service indicated by the Vendor in the Return Form. Without
          prejudice to the application of the mandatory consumer protection
          provisions, all products sold by the Vendor are covered by a
          twenty-four (24) month guarantee for lack of conformity. You shall
          inform the Vendor of the existence of any such lack of conformity
          within a period of two (2) months from the day when you detected the
          lack of conformity. Please contact our Customer Care. In case of lack
          of conformity, you may choose between the repair or replacement of the
          product. If these remedies are impossible or disproportionate you are
          entitled to either require the Vendor to make an appropriate reduction
          in the price or to terminate the contract. Please note that the
          European Commission provides a platform for alternative extra-judicial
          resolution of disputes, available on the website
          http://ec.europa.eu/odr.
